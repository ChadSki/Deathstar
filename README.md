Halo PC Map Deprotection Library

  Deathstar is a deprotection library for deprotecting Halo PC/Mac and Halo Custom Edition maps. It is made to function as both a program for anyone's use and also as a library for projects using the portable C language. While it has functions for opening maps on its own, you can use your own functions.
